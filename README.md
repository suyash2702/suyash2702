# Hi, I'm Suyash 👋

I'm a senior backend engineer, systems designer, and ex-founder who loves building useful things — fast.

Over the last few years, I've:
- 💼 Built the entire backend + CRM systems at **Airblack**, a D2C beauty-tech startup.
- 🧱 Architected scalable microservices in **Node.js**, **Python**, and **Java**.
- 🛠️ Founded **SmartGym** during COVID — bringing gym-at-home to life.
- 🧠 Played with AI/LLMs and built tools like compliance checkers, companion chat apps, and AI-enabled email campaign platforms.
- 📦 Delivered full-stack products for fintech, edtech, and AI startups as a freelancer and founding engineer.

### 🔧 Tech I use (and enjoy)

- **Languages**: Node.js, Python, Java, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Express.js, FastAPI, Spring Boot
- **Infra**: AWS, Docker, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Tools**: Git, CI/CD, Salesforce (yes, I’ve even written Apex)

### ⚡ Currently Exploring
- Building with **LLMs** and vector DBs (RAG, memory systems, roleplay companions)
- Bringing plug-and-play backend architecture to early-stage startups
- Freelancing on **Upwork** to help founders go from idea to MVP

### 🚀 A few things I’ve built
- **CRM & Workflow Engine** from scratch (Airblack)
- **AI Companion Platform** with persistent memory (Dippy)
- **Workout Booking Platform** with React Native + backend APIs
- **Compliance Checker** with OpenAI + web scraping in under 48 hours

### 🎯 Philosophy
> Build fast. Build for scale. Make it feel magical.

I care about shipping quality products quickly — without overengineering. I love collaborating with designers, PMs, and founders who move fast and want real impact.
